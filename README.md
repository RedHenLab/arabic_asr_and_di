# Arabic Speech Recognition and Dialect Identification
## (Under development)

This repository contains my [Google Summer of Code project 2018](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5542722241298432) with [Red Hen Lab](http://www.redhenlab.org/).

The project involves building a speech recognition system for dialectic Arabic. This system will be used to transcribe the Television news broadcast captured by Red Hen in Egypt. It also includes building a system for Arabic dialect identification.

We intend to follow the architectures proposed by the winning teams in the MGB-3 Arabic tasks [1].

This Readme will be updated regularly to include information about the code and guidelines to use this software.
