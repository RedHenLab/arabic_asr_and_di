# Arabic Speech Recognition
## (Under development)

This repository contains an implementation of a speech recognition system for dialectic Arabic. This system will be used to transcribe the Television news broadcast captured by Red Hen in Egypt.

We intend to follow the architectures proposed by the winning team in the MGB-3 Arabic tasks [1].

This Readme will be updated regularly to include information about the code and guidelines to use this software.

# Running the code

1 - Create a file in the base directory ("arabic_asr") and name it "paths.txt"
2 - In this file, include the paths for software to be used in this format:
    `software_name: software_path`
    Currently used software names are:
    - varikn
3 - Run the run.sh script
